# Sakura
A super repository for all my brain dumping, proof of concepts, learning, benhmarking etc.


'Sakura' or Cherry Blossom in Japanese, from my understanding (hope I'm not wrong), it's always symbolized with impermanence. Something that is so wonderful and exciting that only lasts of a short time, just like the Sakura. Most of the ideas here are generally fleeting due to forgotten, abandoned and deprioritized due to other things in life. I just want to keep these ideas alive as long as I could, by documenting all of them here.
